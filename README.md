**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

   We gained user needs from a panel of potentional users. During this panel the users are asked what they would like to see (options, tools, etc.). From here, user stories are created. User stories are little pieces of the overall project. In each of these user stories, there is a title, info on where the piece fits, and bullet points that show, step-by-step, what the developer is supposed to do. For example, if a user Story is Titled: Top Five List. The steps taken might be: User logs in to profile, page loads. User is able to select Top Five link. Link loads new page/new slideshow. User is able to reorder/filter the list. User reorders list, new page loads. By using user stories, the developers can take an idea from the client and incrementally create to get to the desired result, rather than looking at the program from a broader scope. 


**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

   As I am still fairly new to programming, I know there is still so much I can learn. But there were a few things I've learned here in this class. One being to take a project and break it down into smaller parts. Even more so, to write little "bits" of code at a time and compile. Do not over reach my own abilities. And from there, use that same philosophy on the larger scale. Also, and in particular, I very much enjoyed the idea of working in smaller teams on smaller pieces of the overall project. The idea of never truly being along, a work environment that fosters creativity and learning/teaching, is something I hope to work toward in the future. Lastly, the idea of sprinting and iteration, learning from what we do, and moving forward with newly gained knowledge of how to do something better, is also a very exciting idea to take with me on my path.


**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

   A good team member is someoene who comes to each situation/meeting/day with a positive attitude and the willingness to help. The more I learn about software development, the more I am beginning to understand, and grasp, just how large and multi-faceted it all truly is. To build even the most basic of programs can take many hours. One can accomplish this on their own, in their own time, but to get things done in a timely manner, teamwork is needed. And because of this need to work with a  team, being open-minded, accepting other's beliefs, being tolerant of all ways of thinking, and more than anything, to have a willingness to critique properly, and learn to take critique, with the understanding that you are constantly learning/teaching, are all vital to being a good team member.
